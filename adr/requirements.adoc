Status: Active +
Date: 2025-12-16

== Vision

* Stream microscope video over network.
* Support multiple cameras.
* Simple deployment.

== Constraints

* Raspberry Pi Zero (ARMv6). Limited CPU and RAM.
* Home network only. Self-hosted.

== Cameras

* USB HDMI capture (MacroSilicon 534d:2109). Uses OpenCV + V4L2.
* Direct USB camera. Uses OpenCV + V4L2.
* RPi CSI camera (OV5647). Uses libcamera (rpicam-vid).

* Each camera runs in separate container.
* Each camera on different port.
* No routing layer.

== Features

* MJPEG streaming. 640x480 to 1920x1080. 15-60fps.
* Still image capture. Save to disk. Download via web.
* Health endpoint. Battery monitor. LED status indicators.

== Web Interface

* Basic auth except /health.
* Mobile-friendly.
* HTTPS optional (Pi Zero performance).

== Hardware

* Unicorn HAT LEDs for status.
* UPS battery via I2C.
* I2C and SPI enabled.

== Deployment

* Docker Compose. Single command.
* Hardware devices mapped explicitly.
* Environment variable config.
* No privileged mode (unless needed).

== Principles

* One service per camera type.
* App code in containers.
* Missing devices fail startup.
* Environment variables only.

== Out of Scope

Cloud storage. User management. Video recording. Motion detection.
Remote access outside LAN. WebRTC. Multi-user.
