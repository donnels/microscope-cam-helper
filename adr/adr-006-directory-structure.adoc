= ADR-006: Directory Structure

*Status:* Accepted

*Date:* 2025-12-15

== Context

* Need a clear directory structure for project.
* Want to have this as a well documented project.
* People should find files easily (others and me).

== Decision

[source]
----
/docker/
  /docker-microscope/     # Container application
  docker-compose.yml      # Service definition
  README.adoc            # Docker deployment docs

/adr/                    # Architecture decisions

/prep-scripts/          # Hardware prep and test scripts

/images/                 # Diagrams and screenshots

Root level files:
  README.asciidoc        # Main project docs (consolidated)
----

== Consequences

=== Positive

* Clear separation of concerns
* Docker files grouped logically
* Build context simplified
* Easier to find components

== Rationale

`/docker` groups all container-related files.
Sub-directory per container project.
Multiple containers possible in future.

Example expansion:
[source]
----
/docker/
  /docker-microscope/
  /docker-analysis/       # Future: image processing
  /docker-storage/        # Future: backup service
  docker-compose.yml      # Orchestrates all
