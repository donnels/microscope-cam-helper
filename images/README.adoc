== here the overall idea

.Architecture

== Captures from the scope
The following images show why it might not be bad to have different cameras connected to a pi microscope setup even if only one is looking through the scope.

[TIP]
====
It's good to have different views and not just close ups all the time.

.thermal of the pi cam
image::./1765751852542_100.JPG[]

[CAUTION]
====
thermal image shows the pi cam getting hot enough to soften a 3d PLA print easily.
Also it's not the Cam itself but the board... so BEWARE! (note to self: figure out a better way than printing a plastic mount right next to a heat source)
====

[NOTE]
====
The heat seems to stem from SMD parts on the infra red "ears".
It may be possible to just take them off and move them further away from the lens board. The rest seems to be ok for PLA.
